### Project Structure

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PerunNetworkManager/          # Main WPF application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PerunNetworkManager.Core/     # Core business logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PerunNetworkManager.Tests/    # Unit and integration tests
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PerunNetworkManager.Installer/ # WiX installer project
```

## üîÑ Making Changes

### Branching Strategy

We use **Git Flow** with the following branch types:

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - New features
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/*` - Critical production fixes
- `release/*` - Release preparation

### Creating a Feature Branch

```bash
# Start from develop branch
git checkout develop
git pull upstream develop

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make your changes
# ...

# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"

# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### Commit Message Convention

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat` - New features
- `fix` - Bug fixes
- `docs` - Documentation changes
- `style` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor` - Code refactoring
- `test` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore` - Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(scanner): add device vendor identification
fix(ui): resolve theme switching issue in main window
docs: update installation guide with new prerequisites
test(core): add unit tests for profile service
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests** - Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests** - Test component interactions
3. **UI Tests** - Test user interface functionality
4. **Network Tests** - Test network-dependent features (require admin privileges)

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run specific test category
dotnet test --filter "Category=Unit"
dotnet test --filter "Category=Integration"

# Run tests with coverage
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```

### Writing Tests

- **Use descriptive test names** that explain what is being tested
- **Follow AAA pattern** (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- **Mock external dependencies** using Moq or similar frameworks
- **Test both success and failure scenarios**
- **Include edge cases and boundary conditions**

Example:
```csharp
[Test]
[Category("Unit")]
public void NetworkProfile_WithValidConfiguration_ShouldValidateSuccessfully()
{
    // Arrange
    var profile = new NetworkProfile
    {
        Name = "Test Profile",
        IPAddress = "192.168.1.100",
        SubnetMask = "255.255.255.0",
        UseDHCP = false
    };

    // Act
    var isValid = profile.IsValid();

    // Assert
    Assert.IsTrue(isValid);
}
```

## üìù Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Update your branch** with the latest changes from upstream
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull upstream develop
   git checkout your-feature-branch
   git rebase develop
   ```

2. **Ensure tests pass** and code builds successfully
   ```bash
   dotnet build --configuration Release
   dotnet test
   ```

3. **Create a pull request** with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Reference to related issues
   - Screenshots for UI changes
   - Test results if applicable

4. **Pull request template** will be automatically populated

### Pull Request Requirements

- [ ] Code builds successfully
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code follows style guidelines
- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)
- [ ] Breaking changes documented
- [ ] Commits follow conventional commit format

## üé® Code Style

### C# Style Guidelines

We follow Microsoft's C# coding conventions with some additions:

- **Use meaningful names** for variables, methods, and classes
- **Follow PascalCase** for public members, camelCase for private members
- **Use explicit access modifiers** (public, private, etc.)
- **Prefer composition over inheritance**
- **Use async/await** for asynchronous operations
- **Handle exceptions appropriately**

### XAML Guidelines

- **Use consistent indentation** (4 spaces)
- **Group related properties** together
- **Use meaningful names** for controls with x:Name
- **Leverage data binding** instead of code-behind when possible
- **Use resources** for repeated styles and templates

### EditorConfig

We use `.editorconfig` to maintain consistent formatting:

```ini
root = true

[*]
charset = utf-8
end_of_line = crlf
insert_final_newline = true
indent_style = space
indent_size = 4

[*.{cs,csx,vb,vbx}]
indent_size = 4

[*.{xaml}]
indent_size = 4

[*.{json,yml,yaml}]
indent_size = 2
```

## üìö Documentation

### Documentation Standards

- **Code comments** should explain WHY, not WHAT
- **XML documentation** for public APIs
- **README updates** for new features
- **Wiki updates** for significant changes

### Documentation Types

1. **Code Documentation**
   ```csharp
   /// <summary>
   /// Scans the specified subnet for active devices using multi-threaded ping operations.
   /// </summary>
   /// <param name="subnet">The subnet information to scan</param>
   /// <param name="options">Scanning configuration options</param>
   /// <param name="cancellationToken">Token for cancelling the operation</param>
   /// <returns>A list of discovered devices with their network information</returns>
   public async Task<List<ScannedDevice>> ScanSubnetAsync(
       SubnetInfo subnet, 
       ScanOptions options, 
       CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
   ```

2. **User Documentation**
   - Installation guides
   - User manuals
   - Troubleshooting guides
   - FAQ sections

3. **Developer Documentation**
   - API reference
   - Architecture decisions
   - Development setup
   - Contributing guidelines

## üåê Internationalization

### Adding New Languages

1. **Create resource file** in `Resources/Languages/`
   - File naming: `Resources.{language-code}.resx`
   - Example: `Resources.de.resx` for German

2. **Translate all strings** from the base `Resources.en.resx`

3. **Test the translation** in the application

4. **Update language selection** in settings

### Translation Guidelines

- **Maintain context** - Understand where text appears in UI
